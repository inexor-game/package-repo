# Using the repo
## Build your own repo
Just install [repo-make](http://repo-make.tuxfamily.org/) ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/repo-make/)) on the buildhost and execute as `root` repo-make inside.

repo-make will automatically create a dedicated user and will care about the dependencies. [`man repo-make`](http://repo-make.tuxfamily.org/repo-make.1.html) or [`man repo-make.conf`](http://repo-make.tuxfamily.org/repo-make.conf.5.html) may give you more details.
